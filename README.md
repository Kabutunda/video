## Description

This application is designed to be a video upload and streaming service specifically for independent film/TV show creators to upload their work and for industry professionals to find new projects to fund. Unaffiliated viewers can view and provide likes/dislikes to videos posted, providing industry professionals with a barometer of public interest in a work as well. The overall goal of the project is to get more industry eyes on up-and-coming independent creators.

It was created using a MERN-stack setup:

- React.js as the front-end view
- React-Bootstrap for styling
- GraphQL with Node.js and Express.js servers
- MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for database storage
- Heroku for server-side deployment
- JWT (JSON WebTokens) for user authentication
